# Model Evaluation on Iris Dataset
![enter image description here](https://github.com/Kanvigoyal/Model-Evaluation-on-Iris-Dataset/blob/main/Iris.png?raw=true)


Each row in the Iris dataset contains four features (length and width of sepals and petals) of 50 samples of three species of Iris (Iris setosa, Iris virginica and Iris versicolor).

The problem statement here concerns with  **making a model which would help us with the identification of Iris flower species on the basis of flower attribute measurements.**

This project was created as a part of INSAID machine learning intermediate project.
